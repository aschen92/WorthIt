# WorthIt
This was my senior development project in college. It was my first attempt at creating an iOS app. Also first time using Parse as a backend.

Basic Idea: Wartburg was starting a new marketing campaign called Wartburg Worth it and this app would allow current students and alumni to share stories about what made Wartburg worth it to them.
